### IBM Containers - solving problems at light speed with a hosted Docker service
##### Prerequisite information necessary to prepare for [InterConnect 2016](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/) lab
###### Session 1506 - Hands-On Lab Demonstrating the Enterprise-Grade Capabilities of IBM Containers

1.  For this lab, the pre-requisite software is already installed, but to continue leveraging IBM Containers on your systems use the following instructions.
    * Install Docker 1.8.1 or later from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).  The easiest option is to install the full [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).
    * Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI version 6.12.0 or later][cloud-foundry-cli] from the GitHub repository
    * Install the [IBM Containers plugin][ibm-containers-cli] for the Cloud Foundry CLI
2. During the lab session, you can log into the virtual machine (VM) provided on the lab workstations using these credentials:
    * Username: containers
    * Password: containers
    * Once the VM has booted, click on the 'containers' account.
    * ![Login1](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/login1.jpg)
    * Enter the password and click the 'Sign In' button.
    * ![Login2](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/login2.jpg)
    * To access the Terminal window, select 'Activities' and then the 'Terminal' icon.

    * ![Login4](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/login4.jpg)
3. Sign up for an IBM Bluemix account at [https://bluemix.net][bluemix-signup-link]

   ![Signup](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/4-bluemix-trial.jpg)
4.  Log into IBM Bluemix
     ![Bluemix](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/2-bluemix-login.jpg)
     ![Bluemix](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/3-bluemix-login.jpg)
    * From the Bluemix main page, select DASHBOARD, click **Start Containers**  
     ![Start Containers](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/6-start-containers.jpg)
    * Select an image from the list and you will be prompted to **Set registry namespace**.  
     ![Set Namespace](https://github.com/crosen188/ibm-containers-interconnect-2016/blob/master/screenshots/5-set-namespace-new.jpg)
    * NOTE: Enter in a memorable, but usable registry name.  You can only set this value **once** and it cannot be changed afterwards.  This registry name is used across your account when using the IBM Containers service.
    * Choose wisely, make it identifiable, but something you will not mind typing while using the CLI nor something that is embarassing.


You can now close this window to cancel the container deployment process.  You are now ready to begin [Lab 1 - Introduction to IBM Containers and Docker](1-Intro-to-IBM-Containers-and-Docker.md).
