### IBM Containers - solving problems at light speed with a hosted Docker service
##### Prerequisite information necessary to prepare for InterConnect 2016 lab
###### Session 1506 - Hands-On Lab Demonstrating the Enterprise-Grade Capabilities of IBM Containers

1.  Install Docker 1.8.1 or later.
2.  Sign up for an IBM Bluemix account at [https://bluemix.net][bluemix-signup-link]
3.  Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI version 6.12.0 or later][cloud-foundry-cli] from the GitHub repository
4.  Install the [IBM Containers plugin][ibm-containers-cli] for the Cloud Foundry CLI
5.  Sign up for IBM Containers in IBM Bluemix 
    * From the Bluemix dashboard, click **Start Containers**  
    * You will be prompted to **Set registry namespace**.  
    * NOTE: Enter in a memorable, but usable registry name.  You can only set this value **once** and it cannot be changed afterwards.  This registry name is used across your account when using the IBM Containers service.
    * Choose wisely, make it identifiable, but something you will not mind typing while using the CLI nor something that is embarassing.
